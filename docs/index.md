## Welcome to Music Man

MusicMan is a software for music lesson teaching professionals to use to manage their lesson schedule, invoice, take notes and send lesson details and reminders to parents.  

### Summary

There is a need in the music lesson teaching community for a software that does more than just schedule lesson times.  In nearly every case, teachers send their students home with Homework related to specific songs or exercises.  In many cases, students show up the next week having “forgotten” what they should be working on.  While notes can be sent home with children, they often don’t make it home correctly or are promptly lost at home. One great solution is for a teacher to be able to enter lesson notes into a web application and have the notes sent to parents and students electronically.  
In addition to the scheduling component of lessons, many students and parents have a hard time remembering when their lessons take place.  Having the ability to automatically send reminders to parents by email, or by text, could be invaluable.  Nothing is more irritating to a teacher than a student that doesn’t show up, or one that shows up late.  I believe that sending this reminder out at 6pm the night before a lesson would be adequate, though making it configurable would be even better.
Lastly, and this is a stretch goal, it would be good to have the application send invoices to parents so that they can pay their bill using Venmo (or possibly Paypal).  It is sometimes uncomfortable for a teacher to continually hound a parent to have a bill paid, this would make the invoicing and any necessary reminders automated, reducing the potential awkwardness and making the service more professional.
